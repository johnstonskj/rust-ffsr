;;; Tiny Arithmetic Compiler
;;;
;;; This is a very simple compiler for compiling arithmetic expressions consisting of
;;; +, -, * and / into simple virtual machine instructions. The virtual machine just consists
;;; of a number of registers; there is no stack and heap. Thus, the complexity of the
;;; compilable expressions depends a lot on the number of available registers.
;;;
;;; Here is an example for interacting with the compiler and the virtual machine.
;;;
;;; First, we create a new virtual machine with 16 registers:
;;;   (define mvm (make-vm 16))
;;; Next, we compile an arithmetic expression such that the result gets written into
;;; register 0. The resulting machine code gets stored in `code`:
;;;   (define code (compile '(* 7 (+ (* 2 (- 8 3)) 1) (/ 10 2)) 0))
;;; We can pretty print the instructions like this:
;;;   (display-code code)
;;;   =>  (MOV 0 7)
;;;       (MOV 1 2)
;;;       (MOV 2 8)
;;;       (MOV 3 3)
;;;       (SUB 2 3)
;;;       (MUL 1 2)
;;;       (MOV 2 1)
;;;       (ADD 1 2)
;;;       (MUL 0 1)
;;;       (MOV 1 10)
;;;       (MOV 2 2)
;;;       (DIV 1 2)
;;;       (MUL 0 1)
;;; Finally, we can execute the code on virtual machine mvm:
;;;   (execute mvm code)
;;; The result can be found in register 0 of mvm:
;;;   (read-register mvm 0)
;;;   => 385
