;;; Plot graphs into a PDF file
;;;
;;; This is a demo of library (lispkit draw). Function `plot` draws a graph for a
;;; function for a given range using a number of interpolation points into a given
;;; rectangle. `plot` is used a number of times in function `plot-demo-page` which
;;; explains how to compose drawings and save them in a PDF file.
;;;
;;; Usage: (plot-demo-page "graph-demo.pdf")
