;;; HTTP GET demo
;;;
;;; This is a small example for how to use the LispKit-specific `http-get` function.
;;; `http-get` expects two parameters `url` and `timeout`. `url` refers to the URL from
;;; which content should be fetched. `timeout` is a floating point number defining
;;; the time in seconds it should take at most for receiving a response. `http-get`
;;; returns two values: the HTTP header in form of an alist, and the content in form of
;;; a bytevector. The example below assumes that the content is a UTF8 encoded string.
;;;
;;; With the example functions below, it is possible to display this example code by
;;; fetching it from GitHub:
;;; (display (http-get-content "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objecthub/swift-lispkit/master/Sources/LispKit/Resources/Examples/HTTP.scm"))
;;;
;;; There is also a way to open a web page in a browser by using the `open-url` function.
;;; The following code opens the GitHub page of LispKit in a browser:
;;; (open-url "https://github.com/objecthub/swift-lispkit")
