;;; COVID-19 statistics per country
;;;
;;; This is a suite of tools:
;;;   - to download COVID-19 metrics from the GitHub respository maintained by Johns
;;;     Hopkins University,
;;;   - to convert them into a format stored on local disk,
;;;   - to upload the data into a SQLite database,
;;;   - to query the database for per-country statistics, and
;;;   - to illustrate the results by saving various graphs in a PDF file.
;;;
;;; This example code makes use of a whole range of LispKit libraries: `(lispkit gvector)`,
;;; `(lispkit date-time)`, `(lispkit csv)`, `(lispkit sqlite)`, and `(lispkit draw)`.
;;;
;;; Usage:
;;;   1. Create a new empty directory
;;;      (make-directory "~/Desktop/covid")
;;;   2. Download all data from GitHub. This function does not expect an empty directory.
;;;      It will complete the missing data and not touch existing files.
;;;      (download-daily-metrics "~/Desktop/covid")
;;;   3. Read the metric files in the given directory and upload the data into a new SQLite
;;;      database.
;;;      (create-db "~/Desktop/covid.sqlite3" "~/Desktop/covid")
;;;   4. Query the database to obtain a report for the given country.
;;;      (define covid-start (date-time 2020 02 25))
;;;      (define covid-ch (query-country-metrics "~/Desktop/covid.sqlite3" "CH" covid-start))
;;;      (define covid-de (query-country-metrics "~/Desktop/covid.sqlite3" "DE" covid-start))
;;;      (define covid-us (query-country-metrics "~/Desktop/covid.sqlite3" "US" covid-start))
;;;   5. Generate a country-specific report as a PDF.
;;;      (save-country-report "~/Desktop/covid-ch-report.pdf" covid-ch "CH" 3 12 1000 100)
;;;      (save-country-report "~/Desktop/covid-de-report.pdf" covid-de "DE" 3 12 10000 500)
;;;      (save-country-report "~/Desktop/covid-us-report.pdf" covid-us "US" 3 12 100000 2500)
;;;
;;; LispKit comes with all the assets needed for this example code, in case an internet connection
;;; is not available. The directory containing the metric files can be found at
;;; `internal-covid-dir`, the sqlite3 database containing the processed data is located at
;;; `internal-covid-db`.
