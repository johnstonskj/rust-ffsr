;;; LISPKIT DRAW TURTLE
;;;
;;; This is a simple library implementing turtle graphics. A new turtle plane gets created
;;; by invoking `make-turtle`. `make-turtle` sets the origin of the plane as well as a scaling
;;; factor. A range of functions for modifying the state of a turtle plane is provided:
;;; 
;;;   - `(pen-up turtle)`: Lifts the turtle from the plane
;;;   - `(pen-down turtle)`: Drops the turtle onto the plane
;;;   - `(pen-color color turtle)`: Sets the current color of the turtle
;;;   - `(pen-size size turtle)`: Sets the size of the turtle pen
;;;   - `(home)`: Moves the turtle back to the origin
;;;   - `(move x y turtle)`: Moves the turtle to position `(x, y)`
;;;   - `(heading angle turtle)`: Sets the angle of the turtle (in radians)
;;;   - `(turn angle turtle)`: Turns the turtle by the given angle (in radians)
;;;   - `(left angle turtle)`: Turn left by the given angle (in radians)
;;;   - `(right angle turtle)`: Turn right by the given angle (in radians)
;;;   - `(forward length turtle)`: Moves forward by `length` units drawing a line if the
;;;     pen is down
;;;   - `(backward length turtle)`: Moves backward by `length` units drawing a line if the
;;;     pen is down
