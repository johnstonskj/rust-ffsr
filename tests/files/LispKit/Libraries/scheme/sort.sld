;;; SCHEME SORT
;;;
;;; Scheme sorting library. This library is part of the Scheme Red edition of the R7RS
;;; large language. It is incomplete in that it does not support mutable list-related
;;; procedures due to LispKit's lists being immutable. The following procedures are
;;; missing: `list-delete-neighbor-dups!`, `list-merge!`, `list-sort!`, `list-stable-sort!`.
