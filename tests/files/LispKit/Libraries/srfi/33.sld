;;; SRFI 33
;;; Integer Bitwise-operation Library
;;;
;;; R5RS Scheme has no utilities for performing bitwise logical operations on integers
;;; or bitstrings, which is a problem for authors of portable code. This SRFI proposes
;;; a coherent and comprehensive set of these functions. The precise semantics of these
;;; operators is almost never an issue. A consistent, portable set of *names* and
;;; parameter conventions, however, is. Hence this SRFI.
