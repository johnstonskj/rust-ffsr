;;; SRFI 137
;;; Minimal Unique Types
;;;
;;; This SRFI is intended to standardize a primitive run-time mechanism to create
;;; disjoint types. This mechanism provides a simple hook to create new data types at
;;; run time that are disjoint from all existing types. allowing portable libraries to
;;; implement SRFI 9, SRFI 99, SRFI 131, SRFI 135, R6RS records, Chicken records, CLOS,
;;; persistent databases, remote access to data on servers, and the like on top of it.
;;; It is also portably implementable and usable entirely separately from any of these.
;;;
;;; Note that there is no concept of a type object here: a type is simply a name for a
;;; group of closely linked procedures that allow the creation and manipulation of type
;;; instances (which are objects) and subtypes. This SRFI exposes no ambient authority,
;;; and relies entirely on module exports for access control.
