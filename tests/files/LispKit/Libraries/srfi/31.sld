;;; SRFI 31
;;; A special form rec for recursive evaluation.
;;;
;;; This SRFI implements a special form called `rec`. This form is a generalization and
;;; combination of the forms `rec` and `named-lambda` of [Clinger1985]. It allows the
;;; simple and non-imperative construction of self-referential expressions. As an important
;;; special case, it extends the A. Church form lambda such that it allows the direct
;;; definition of recursive procedures without using further special forms like `let` or
;;; `letrec`, without using advanced constructions like the H. B. Curry combinator and,
;;; unlike `define`, without introducing variable bindings into the external environment.
