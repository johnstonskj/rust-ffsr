;;; SRFI 41 Primitive
;;; Streams
;;;
;;; Streams, sometimes called lazy lists, are a sequential data structure containing elements
;;; computed only on demand. A stream is either null or is a pair with a stream in its cdr.
;;; Since elements of a stream are computed only when accessed, streams can be infinite.
;;; Once computed, the value of a stream element is cached in case it is needed again.
;;;
;;; Streams without memoization were first described by Peter Landin in 1965. Memoization
;;; became accepted as an essential feature of streams about a decade later. Today, streams
;;; are the signature data type of functional programming languages such as Haskell.
;;;
;;; This Scheme Request for Implementation describes two libraries for operating on streams:
;;; a canonical set of stream primitives and a set of procedures and syntax derived from
;;; those primitives that permits convenient expression of stream operations.
