;;; SRFI 2
;;; AND-LET*: an AND with local bindings, a guarded LET* special form
;;;
;;; Like an ordinary AND, an AND-LET* special form evaluates its arguments - expressions - one
;;; after another in order, till the first one that yields #f. Unlike AND, however, a non-#f
;;; result of one expression can be bound to a fresh variable and used in the subsequent
;;; expressions. AND-LET* is a cross-breed between LET* and AND.
