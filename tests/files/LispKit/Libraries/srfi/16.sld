;;; SRFI 16
;;; Syntax for procedures of variable arity
;;;
;;; The SRFI introduces `case-lambda`, a syntax for procedures with a variable number
;;; of arguments. `case-lambda` reduces the clutter of procedures that execute different
;;; code depending on the number of arguments they were passed. It is a pattern-matching
;;; mechanism that matches on the number of arguments. CASE-LAMBDA is available in some
;;; Scheme systems.
