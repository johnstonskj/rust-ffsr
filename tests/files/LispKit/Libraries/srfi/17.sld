;;; SRFI 17
;;; Generalized set!
;;;
;;; This is a proposal to allow procedure calls that evaluate to the "value of a location"
;;; to be used to set the value of the location, when used as the first operand of set!.
;;; For example: (set! (vector-ref x 0) 17)
;;; becomes equivalent to: (vector-set! x 0 17)
;;;
;;; Many programming languages have the concept of an lvalue. that is an "expression" that
;;; "evaluates" to a location, and which can appear on the left-hand-side of an assignment.
;;; Common Lisp has a related concept of "generalized variables" which can be used in `setf`
;;; and some other special forms. However, the Common Lisp concept is based on the idea of
;;; compile-time recognition of special "location-producing" functions; this does not seem
;;; to be in the "spirit of Scheme".
;;;
;;; This SRFI implements an extension of set! so that it provides similar functionality as
;;; Common Lisp's `setf`, except that the updater is associated with a procedure value,
;;; rather than a name.
