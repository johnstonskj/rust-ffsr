;;; SRFI SICP (equivalent to SRFI 216)
;;; SICP Prerequisites
;;;
;;; This SRFI provides "out-of-the-box" support for hosting the exercises suggested by
;;; "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs". It primarily provides procedures
;;; for working with time data and streams, as well as SICP names for true and false.
;;; Support for multi-threading is omitted due to LispKit currently not supporting threads.
;;; None of the provided procedures are fit for production use. They are only designed for
;;; pedagogical purposes. Students are expected to be able to just write
;;;
;;;   (include (srfi sicp))
;;;
;;; and have the code from the book run without problems (apart from those intended by the
;;; book authors).
