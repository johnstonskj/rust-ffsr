;;; SRFI 151
;;; Bitwise Operations
;;;
;;; This SRFI proposes a coherent and comprehensive set of procedures for performing bitwise
;;; logical operations on integers; it is accompanied by a reference implementation of the
;;; spec in terms of a set of seven core operators. The sample implementation is portable,
;;; as efficient as practical with pure Scheme arithmetic (it is much more efficient to
;;; replace the core operators with C or assembly language if possible), and open source.
;;;
;;; The precise semantics of these operators is almost never an issue. A consistent, portable
;;; set of names and parameter conventions, however, is. Hence this SRFI, which is based
;;; mainly on SRFI 33, with some changes and additions from Olin's late revisions to SRFI 33
;;; (which were never consummated). SRFI 60 (based on SLIB) is smaller but has a few procedures
;;; of its own; some of its procedures have both native (often Common Lisp) and SRFI 33 names.
;;; They have been incorporated into this SRFI. R6RS is a subset of SRFI 60, except that all
;;; procedure names begin with a bitwise- prefix. A few procedures have been added from the
;;; general vector SRFI 133.
;;;
;;; This SRFI differs from SRFI 142 in only three ways:
;;;    1. The bitwise-if function has the argument ordering of SLIB, SRFI 60, and R6RS rather
;;;       than the ordering of SRFI 33.
;;;    2. The order in which bits are processed by the procedures listed in the "Bits conversion"
;;;       section has been clarified and some of the procedures' names have been changed.
;;;    3. The LispKit port for SRFI 151 is using native bitwise operations for fixnums and
;;;       bignums. Its performance is significantly better than the one of SRFI 142.

    ;;; Finally, note that even Feeley's expression can't build an N-bit mask
