;;; Basic hash tables
;;;
;;; This SRFI defines basic hash tables. Hash tables are widely recognised as a
;;; fundamental data structure for a wide variety of applications. A hash table
;;; is a data structure that:
;;;
;;;   1. provides a mapping from some set of keys to some set of values
;;;      associated to those keys
;;;   2. has no intrinsic order for the (key, value) associations it contains
;;;   3. supports in-place modification as the primary means of setting the
;;;      contents of a hash table
;;;   4. provides key lookup and destructive update in amortised constant time,
;;;      provided that a good hash function is used.
;;;
;;; This SRFI aims to accomplish these goals:
;;;
;;;   1. to provide a consistent, generic and widely applicable API for hash tables
;;;   2. to improve code portability by providing a standard hash table facility
;;;      with guaranteed behaviour
;;;   3. to help the programmer by defining utility routines that account for the
;;;      most common situations of using hash tables.
