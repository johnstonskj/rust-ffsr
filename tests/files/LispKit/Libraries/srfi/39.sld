;;; SRFI 39
;;; Parameter objects
;;;
;;; This SRFI defines parameter objects, the procedure `make-parameter` to create parameter
;;; objects and the `parameterize` special form to dynamically bind parameter objects.
;;; In the dynamic environment, each parameter object is bound to a cell containing the
;;; value of the parameter. When a procedure is called, the called procedure inherits the
;;; dynamic environment from the caller. The `parameterize` special form allows the binding
;;; of a parameter object to be changed for the dynamic extent of its body.
