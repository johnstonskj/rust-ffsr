;;; Render markdown in a graphics window
;;;
;;; This is a demo showing how to combine functionality to parse and convert text in
;;; Markdown format with LispKit's drawing library as well as LispPad's capabilities to
;;; create graphics windows and display rich text.
;;;
;;; Function `render-markdown` below reads a text file at _path_, parses it as text
;;; in Markdown format, converts that into HTML and displays the HTML in a new graphics
;;; window with _title_ as its title. The function returns the identity of the window.
