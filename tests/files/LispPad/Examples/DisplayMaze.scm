;;; Display mazes in a graphics window
;;;
;;; This is an extension of the `LispKit` sample code "Examples/Maze.scm". It loads the
;;; `LispKit` sample code and implements a simple function on top which displays mazes
;;; in `LispPad` graphics windows.
;;;
;;; Usage:
;;;   (show-maze (make-maze/randomized-dfs 30 30) 15 15 "Maze from randomized DFS algorithm")
;;;   (show-maze (make-maze/bintree 30 30) 15 15 "Maze from binary tree algorithm")
