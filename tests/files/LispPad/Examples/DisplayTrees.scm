;;; Draw binary trees in a graphics window
;;;
;;; This is an extension of the `LispKit` sample code "Examples/DrawTrees.scm". It
;;; loads the `LispKit` sample code and implements a simple function on top which
;;; displays binary trees in `LispPad` graphics windows.
;;; 
;;; Binary trees are represented as s-expressions. An inner node of a binary tree is
;;; represented by a list with tree elements: `(<label> <left tree> <right tree>)`. A
;;; leaf node is just a label. For example: `(1 (2 3 (4 5 #f)) (6 #f 7))` represents
;;; this binary tree:
;;; 
;;;              1
;;;            /   \
;;;           2     6
;;;          / \     \
;;;         3   4     7
;;;            /
;;;           5
;;; 
;;; `test-tree-1`, `test-tree-2`, `test-tree-3`, `test-tree-4`, and ``test-tree-5` are
;;; example trees. They can be displayed in a graphics window via procedure `show-tree`.
;;;
;;; Usage:
;;;   (show-tree test-tree-1)
;;;   (show-tree test-tree-2)
;;;   (show-tree test-tree-3)
;;;   (show-tree test-tree-4)
;;;   (show-tree test-tree-5)
