;;; LISPKIT LOG
;;;
;;; Simple logging library for LispKit. This library has been adapted to LispPad to make
;;; use of LispPad's session log. It has the same interface like the original library.
;;; For advanced features, library `(lisppad log)` should be used.
;;;
;;; With library `(lispkit log)`, all log entries are sent to a _logger_. A logger
;;; processes each log entry (e.g. by adding or filtering information) and eventually
;;; persist it if the severity of the log entry is at or above the level of the severity
;;; of the logger. Supported are logging to a port and into a file. A log entry consists
;;; of the following four components: a timestamp, a severity, a sequence of tags, and a
;;; log message. Timestamps are generated via `current-second`. There are five severities
;;; supported by this library: `debug` (0), `info` (1), `warn` (2), `err` (3), and `fatal` (4).
;;; Each tag is represented as a symbol. The sequence of tags is represented as a list of
;;; symbols. A log message is a string.
;;;
;;; Logging functions take the logger as an optional argument. If it is not provided, the
;;; _current logger_ is chosen. The current logger is represented via the parameter object
;;; `current-logger`. The current logger is initially set to the `default-logger`.
